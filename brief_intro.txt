A list is similar to a vector in that it can store multiple elements of the same type and dynamically grow in size.

However, two major differences between lists and vectors are:

*You can add and remove elements from both the beginning and at the end of a list, while vectors are generally optimized for adding and removing at the end.

*Unlike vectors, a list does not support random access, meaning you cannot directly jump to a specific index, or access elements by index numbers.
